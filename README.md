# The Dwarf Planet

Upon launching the webpage, you are greeted with a solar system with the default directory as ' /old '. Each planet in the solar system is clickable, leading to individual pages numbered from 0 to 9.

Upon checking the footer, it is revealed that the webpage was hosted in 2006. By changing the URL to ' /new ', an updated solar system is revealed, where Pluto has been replaced with an unclickable '?' planet.

Manually changing the directory to ' /new/9 ' reveals a page with the following question:
